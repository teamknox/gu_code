Groovy-IoT
====

Overview
 Groovy-IoT system (hardware and software) can handle various Grove System type sensors by your using PC directly.

## Description
 Grove System are suitable for newbie of IoT. However not exisiting good solution for handling them directly from our using PC. Grooby-IoT can solve the issue. So far, Groovy-IoT are on going to check each sensor connectivity. 

 ### Grove System
  see Grove System (http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_System/) several definition for I/O capability such as simple GPIO, ADC, Serial and I2C. Grove System is originally developed for Arduino ehnacement (a.k.a Shield). Delivative is Grove-Pi+ for Raspberry Pi, maybe you know. 

 ### MCP2221A
  MCP2221A is a bridge-chip for USB. It contains Grove System interface and DAC capabilty too. Arduino-Shield and Raspberry-Pi GPIO are proprietary, not for used to vise-versa. However, Groovy-IoT is totally USB, can be used to Raspberry-Pi too (can be replaced) !!

## Demo
 Several demo (code) are provided.

 ### GPIO
  #### LED-blinking
  Very basic code as same meaning "Hello World !", important step for just begun.

  #### Button-read
  

 ### Serial
  #### GPS

 ### I2C
  #### BME280 (I2C)

 ### ADC
  #### Moisture sensor

 ### Node-RED
